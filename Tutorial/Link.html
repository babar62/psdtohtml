    GETTING STARTED WITH BRACKETS</h1>
<h2>This is your guide!</h2>
        <p id="guid">   <em>Welcome to Brackets,</em> a modern open-source code editor that understands web design. It's a lightweight, yet powerful, code editor that blends visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help when you want it.</p>

        <p><em>Brackets is a different type of editor. </em>Brackets has some unique features like Quick Edit, Live Preview and others that you may not find in other editors. Brackets is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. That means that most of you using Brackets have the skills necessary to modify and extend the editor. In fact, we use Brackets every day to build Brackets. To learn more about how to use the key features, read on.</p>

        <h2>Projects in Brackets</h2>
        <p id="project">In order to edit your own code using Brackets, you can just open the folder containing your files. Brackets treats the currently open folder as a "project"; features like Code Hints, Live Preview and Quick Edit only use files within the currently open folder.</p>

        <h2>Quick Edit for CSS and JavaScript</h2>
<p id="edit">No more switching between documents and losing your context. When editing HTML, use the Cmd/Ctrl + E shortcut to open a quick inline editor that displays all the related CSS. Make a tweak to your CSS, hit ESC and you're back to editing HTML, or just leave the CSS rules open and they'll become part of your HTML editor. If you hit ESC outside of a quick inline editor, they'll all collapse. Quick Edit will also find rules defined in LESS and SCSS files, including nested rules.</p>
        <h2>Preview HTML and CSS changes live in the browser</h2>
        <p id="preview">You know that "save/reload dance" we've been doing for years? The one where you make changes in your editor, hit save, switch to the browser and then refresh to finally see the result? With Brackets, you don't have to do that dance.<br>

            Brackets will open a live connection to your local browser and push HTML and CSS updates as you type! You might already be doing something like this today with browser-based tools, but with Brackets there is no need to copy and paste the final code back into the editor. Your code runs in the browser, but lives in your editor!</p>

        <h2>Live Highlight HTML elements and CSS rules</h2>
<p id="rules">Brackets makes it easy to see how your changes in HTML and CSS will affect the page. When your cursor is on a CSS rule, Brackets will highlight all affected elements in the browser. Similarly, when editing an HTML file, Brackets will highlight the corresponding HTML elements in the browser.a<br>

    Today, Brackets only supports Live Preview for HTML and CSS. However, in the current version, changes to JavaScript files are automatically reloaded when you save. We are currently working on Live Preview support for JavaScript. Live previews are also only possible with Google Chrome, but we hope to bring this functionality to all major browsers in the future.</p>

        <h2>Quick View</h2>
        <p id="quick">For those of us who haven't yet memorized the color equivalents for HEX or RGB values, Brackets makes it quick and easy to see exactly what color is being used. In either CSS or HTML, simply hover over any color value or gradient and Brackets will display a preview of that color/gradient automatically. The same goes for images: simply hover over the image link in the Brackets editor and it will display a thumbnail preview of that image.</p>

        <h2>Need something else? Try an extension!</h2>
        <p id="extension">In addition to all the goodness that's built into Brackets, our large and growing community of extension developers has built hundreds of extensions that add useful functionality. If there's something you need that Brackets doesn't offer, more than likely someone has built an extension for it. To browse or search the list of available extensions, choose File > Extension Managerâ€¦ and click on the "Available" tab. When you find an extension you want, just click the "Install" button next to it.</p>
